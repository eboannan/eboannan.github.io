## About
These pages document my past, present and future research works. I summarize these works with publication/code links where applicable.
You will also find tutorials, writings and musings on various topics on python programming, machine learning, spectroscopy, statistics and probability.

I obtained my PhD in Physical Chemistry from the University of Florida doing research in Laser-induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). I investigated the use of molecular species formed during LIBS as an analytical quantification technique.

After my doctorate, I did a one year postdoc at the Optical Science Center for Applied Research in Delaware. Whiles there,  I did work on using machine learning on LIBS spectra for detecting ovarian cancer in mice.

I also did another postdoc at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell on using LIBS together with machine learning for the detection of melanoma cancer and Alzheimers using biological samples. I also did NASA-sponsored researches on; simulating the LIBS process, use of machine learning to preprocess LIBS spectra at scale and automating the fitting of emission lines in LIBS spectra.

I am currently a Senior Algorithms Development Scientist at [Nova Measuring Instruments](https://www.novami.com/) where I develop algorithms for XPS, XRF, SIMS, OCD and other technologies.

### Design Principles 
When designinig a class in python, you should be guided by the SOLID principles:
1. <span style="color:red">**S**</span>ingle responsibility
2. <span style="color:red">**O**</span>pen to extension but closed to modification
3. <span style="color:red">**L**</span>iskov substitution
4. <span style="color:red">**I**</span>nterface segregation
5. <span style="color:red">**D**</span>ependency inversion

### Design Patterns
Knowing the design patterns allows you to easily write robust code using time-tested techniques. It also facilitates common-ground collaboration and communications among developers. I will cover the common 23 design patterns summarized by the Gang of Four:

Creational:
1. Factory
2. Abstract Factory
3. Prototype
4. Singleton
6. Builder

Structural:
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

Behavioral:
1. Iterator
2. Observer
3. Chain of Responsibility
4. Command
5. Memento
6. Mediator
7. State
8. Visitor
9. Strategy
10. Template

## Design Architectures
1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
